Right now we rely on beaconcha.in and many of our users have requested that we use the eth2 client's API. At the time we implemented staking API was not yet stable. We would have to do research if this has changed since then.\n- Support ETH staking via exchanges such as kraken and binance.\n- Allow treating of ETH2 (beacon chain ETH) and ETH as the same thing for accounting. Current implementation treats them as different assets.\n- Continuous support of the implementation and adjust for changes that the merge will bring.",

        "tagline": "The project conducts an open-source data analysis on Ethereum staking pools to help understand the current state of Ethereum staking.",
        "description": "## Motivation\nEthereum staking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to the [deposit contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa), calling the \"deposit\" ABI, and emitting a \"DepositEvent\". A validator‘s pubkey is then valid for staking on the beacon chain.\n\nSince beacon chain staking is complicated and requires some professional knowledge, many staking pools provide simpler staking services to ordinary ETH holders based on the beacon chain. These [staking pools](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices) generate many validators by depositing ETH from the same address or addresses with the same \"name tag\". It is possible to group validators into different staking pools for further analysis according to such features.\n\nSeveral projects are working on analyzing Ethereum staking pools, like [rated.network](https://www.rated.network/), [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/pools), [ethereumpools.info](http://ethereumpools.info), [pools.invis.cloud](https://pools.invis.cloud/), and showing different analyzing results. However, these projects are not open-source, resulting in the uncertainty of the data accuracy and thus confusing us with which one we should refer to.\n\nTherefore, we decide to conduct open-source data analytics on Ethereum staking pools. The source code is uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/Zachary-Lingle/ethsta_staking_analysis) and the data is visualized on [ethsta.com](https://ethsta.com/).\n## How it works \n![](https://i.imgur.com/lUJjloC.png)\n\n## ETL\nAll the raw data is obtained from [Etherscan APIs](https://etherscan.io/apis).\n1. DepositEvent\n   1. txid: the transaction that calls the deposit contract and emits the event\n   2. eth2_validator: the validator pubkey in the calldata\n2. Internal transaction (the contract caller is another contract, like Lido)\n   1. txid: the transaction id that generates the internal transaction\n   2. from: the address that creates the transaction\n   3. value: the ETH amount of the internal transaction\n3. Transaction (the contract caller is an EOA, like Coinbase)\n   1. txid: the transaction id\n   2. from: the address that creates the transaction\n   3. value: the ETH amount of the transaction\n4. Tag\n   1. address: an EOA address or contract address\n   2. name: the \"name tag\" of the address on Etherscan\n   \n## Grouping\nThe grouping process is written in Python, but we'd like to describe it with SQL for simplicity as follows.\n```sql\nSELECT\n   name,\n   COUNT(eth2_validator) as validator_count,\n   SUM(value) as total_value,\n   COLLECT_SET(eth2_validator) as eth2_address,\n   COLLECT_SET(from) as eth1_address\nFROM event, internal_transaction, transaction, tag\nWHERE\n   event.txid = internal_transaction.txid\n   AND event.txid = transaction.txid\n   AND tag.address = internal_transaction.from\n   AND tag.address = transaction.from\n```\n## Visualization and some Initial Results\n![](https://imgur.com/tcZeijE.png)\n![](https://imgur.com/UiovwVg.png)\n\nFrom the pie chart on ethsta.com, we can see that Lido owns more than 1/4 validators. The top 3 staking pools, Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, own more than 1/2 validators. We can also see from the table that the top 3 staking pools are still growing fast in validator counts and deposit amounts. Besides, about 30% of validators are classified into \"others\", since we are not able to obtain their address tags.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/nxVY4ho.png)\n\nThe stacked area chart above presents the growth trend of the number of validators owned by various staking pools. The data shows that some traditional exchanges and mining pools started Ethereum staking first, but were greatly surpassed by Coinbase and Lido since May 2021, the time they decided to join in a big way. The two pools then maintained a linear growth trend until Lido's surge recently, making its curve begin to approach exponential growth.\n\nIn general, the proportion of Ethereum staking is more and more inclined toward Lido and Coinbase since their large participation. Now, merely Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken have together controlled more than 50% of validators.\n\n## Future Work\nWe will continue to analyze the validators in \"others\", trying to find out the entities behind them. Welcome to raise issues to point out data faults. BTW, we are also interested in the data analytics of client diversity which may help in the upcoming Ethereum \"the merge\".",

        "description": "# 📖 Introduction:\n\nWith The Merge almost ready to be rolled out, Ethereum is getting very close to the transition from PoW to PoS, where validators will be the new miners, with the responsibility that comes with it. Since all consensus information is publicly available in the beacon chain, each validator can be tracked and monitored to see how it performs. There are some open-source tools like beaconcha.in that do a great job when it comes to monitoring individual validators.\n\nHowever, not every single validator belongs to a different entity. It's quite common that a set of several hundreds of validators belong to the same staker/node-operator/pool. Here is where ethereumpools.info comes into play, by:\n* Grouping validators belonging to different entities\n* Calculating metrics on these groups of validators\n\nThis allow us to compare them against each other, so that if a given pool performs way worse than the average, we can flag it and report it. This incentivises pool operators to improve their performance, which leads to users getting more rewards, and ultimately improving the network health.\n\nOn top of that, our tool focuses on real-time data, which differentiates us from other projects, allowing us to be the first ones reporting pools downtime, something that we do quite often in our [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/EthereumPools).\n\n# 👷‍♀️ What's done?\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have successfully delivered:\n* [eth-metrics](https://github.com/alrevuelta/eth-metrics/) repository, the core of our dashboard.\n* [eth-deposits](https://github.com/alrevuelta/eth-deposits) repository, an ongoing initiative to provide transparency to validator labelling.\n* ethereumpools.info public dashboard, monitoring more than 50 pools every single epoch in real time.\n* [EthereumPools](https://twitter.com/EthereumPools) twitter account, where we report the downtime we detect.\n\n# ✅ What's next?\n\nOver that last months we have delivered many features, but we have more to come in the pipeline:\n\n* Improve the validator labeling in collaboration with the community and other projects that also rely on this information.\n* Analyse deposits in order to understand how decentralised the network is in terms of the so-called operator-diversity, just as important as client-diversity.\n* Improve the eth-metrics tool, make it more efficient, add new features, maintain it over\ntime (the-merge, shanghai fork, etc).\n* Improve the user interface making it more user-friendly and easier to navigate.\n* Explore integrations with EPNS or other services, so that we can have an automated alerting system that anyone can integrate with.\n* Establish an open channel and offer mutual collaboration to pools and operators, in order to upstream the Ethereum ethos to them and help them if we find issues with their pools.\n* Be a trusted entity by users/delegators, so that they can check the performance, decentralisation or rewards of the pool they use. A pool earning 5% on their stake but only sharing 2% with their customers can be exposed by us. Promote the \"Know Your Pool\" motto, helping to provide transparency in staking.\n\n# 🤔 What do we need?\n\nWe need you 🤟! If you want to help the best way is by sending us feedback, requesting features, contributing to our repo or just saying Hi! on Twitter. But if you feel like it, you can also contribute with some funds, that will be used to pay our expensive cloud costs, subscriptions to different services like infura/alchemy and hiring someone to help us working on it.\n\n# 👪 Collaborators\n\nThis project is developed in collaboration with MigaLabs, the creators of the armiarma crawler that monitors client diversity.\n\n# ethereumpools.eth",

The world needs open, censorship-resistant alternatives to the centralized platforms that dominate today!\n\n## Easy\nDAppNode makes it extremely simple for anyone to run nodes or validators and start participating and contributing in different networks, validating PoS chains and earning rewards for doing so. \n\n## Public Good:\nMost DApps are not decentralized. Nobody is to blame for that: To begin with, DApps need access to nodes to work: that means either become a centralizing vector yourself and maintain your own node at a considerable cost and headache, or go to another player that does that at scale and is more efficient but also has more power over the data - Infura or other Node-as-a-Service providers. A DApp developer does not necessarily want to be an infrastructure provider, so it’s just normal that it would pay someone to do so. \n\n\nSecondly, DApps need to be as usable and accessible as any other app - which means that they need to go through the distribution channels users are used to: a website, an app store, etc. Considering that accessing decentralized websites requires extra steps from the user (like using an IPFS gateway to access decentralized front-ends, for example), and we want to make it easier for them, it is just easier to use a standard hosting service that most likely ends up in AWS, GC or Azure.\n\n\nSo: we're bringing a way 1) for users to maintain their own nodes to connect to whatever DApps they want; and 2) for teams to distribute their products and DApps easily and in a completely decentralized way!\n\n\n\nAll of this, free and open source.

Validators also face issues, with a limit of 32 ETH per node, validators are forced to self fund or find investors to help expand.
